        <h3>Description</h3>
        The only drink I order from Starbucks anymore. Love the richness
        from the cream, which I don't get from the lattes.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

            <li>3 tbsp of heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>2tbsp of vanilla syrup</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of milk</li>
            <li>ice</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour the heavy whipping cream, vanilla syrup, and milk
                into the your glass and stir until combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the cold brew and water into your glass.</li>
            <li>Add as much ice to your liking in your glass.</li>
            <li>Stir until it's all one color.</li>
            <li>Sip and enjoy!</li>

        </ol>
